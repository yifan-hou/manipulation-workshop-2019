We are seeing a growing need of dexterity in robotic manipulation beyond grasping. Such dexterity is usually motivated by a creative use of contacts, where these contacts can come from robot hands, arms, or any objects and fixtures in the environment. An intelligent robot can manipulate an object or its own body by exploiting the geometric and force constraints offered through contacts. Such skillful use of contact interactions could  be crucial for realizing dexterous, reactive and robust robotic manipulation as well as mobile legged locomotion (self-manipulation).

While highly desired, such contact-rich manipulation comes with its own challenges -- from noisy sensors to computationally demanding planning and control frameworks. While the recent research has proposed efficient algorithms and solutions for dexterous and robust manipulation, the industrial applications are seldom seen. This workshop aims to address and hopefully bridge this gap by inviting leading researchers from academia to discuss the recent advances in the field and industry experts to share their experiences and needs from the contact-rich robotic manipulation in industry. We hope this workshop can encourage discussions about possible transfers between the academic results and industrial applications.

## When and where
* Nov. 8th, 9am ~ 5:30pm
* Room: LG-R20

## Topics of interest
- Non-prehensile Manipulation

- Grasp planning, Motion planning, and Task Planning for Manipulators
- Model/Policy Learning for Manipulation through Contacts
- Whole-body Manipulation
- Locomotion/Self-manipulation considering Contacts and Gravitational Constraints

## Open Talk Session
The workshop has several open talk sessions. The application is open to both academia and industry. Everyone can apply for a talk to share their work on related fields. The talk should be around 5 min plus Q&A.

**How to apply**

Please send an email to <a href = "mailto: manipulation.workshop@gmail.com">manipulation.workshop@gmail.com</a> with title *Application for open talk*.
Please include the following information in your email:
- Title and abstract of your talk;
- Brief self-introduction. (< 100 words)

Please apply early, as the positions are limited.

**Important dates**

First round of applications ends at October 6th.

For the remaining slots, we will assign them in a first-come, first serve manner. Applications will receive the decisions within five days. All applications must be received before October 25th.

<font color="red"> (Oct.12) The open talk slots are full. The application is now closed. </font>
