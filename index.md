We are seeing a growing need of dexterity in robotic manipulation beyond grasping. Such dexterity is usually motivated by a creative use of contacts, where these contacts can come from robot hands, arms, or any objects and fixtures in the environment. An intelligent robot can manipulate an object or its own body by exploiting the geometric and force constraints offered through contacts. Such skillful use of contact interactions could  be crucial for realizing dexterous, reactive and robust robotic manipulation as well as mobile legged locomotion (self-manipulation).

While highly desired, such contact-rich manipulation comes with its own challenges -- from noisy sensors to computationally demanding planning and control frameworks. While the recent research has proposed efficient algorithms and solutions for dexterous and robust manipulation, the industrial applications are seldom seen. This workshop aims to address and hopefully bridge this gap by inviting leading researchers from academia to discuss the recent advances in the field and industry experts to share their experiences and needs from the contact-rich robotic manipulation in industry. We hope this workshop can encourage discussions about possible transfers between the academic results and industrial applications.

## Call for Open Talks
In this workshop, we have a one-hour open talk session, everyone can apply for a talk to share their work on related fields. Application is open to both academia and industry.

### Format
Each speaker will speak for 3\~5 minutes, followed by a 2min Q&A. Instead of using slides, please record a video (3\~5 min) of your slides.

### How to apply
Please send an email to <a href = "mailto: manipulation.workshop@gmail.com">manipulation.workshop@gmail.com</a> with title *Application for open talk*.
Please include the following information in your email:
- Title and abstract of your talk;
- Brief self-introduction. (< 100 words)

Please apply early, as the positions are limited.

### Important dates
Applications must be received before October 1st.

### List of open talks
A list will be available before the workshop.
