## Introduction
We are seeing a growing need of dexterity in robotic manipulation beyond grasping. Such dexterity is usually motivated by a creative use of contacts, where these contacts can come from robot hands, arms, or any objects and fixtures in the environment. An intelligent robot can manipulate an object or its own body by exploiting the geometric and force constraints offered through contacts. Such skillful use of contact interactions could  be crucial for realizing dexterous, reactive and robust robotic manipulation as well as mobile legged locomotion (self-manipulation).

While highly desired, such contact-rich manipulation comes with its own challenges -- from noisy sensors to computationally demanding planning and control frameworks. While the recent research have proposed efficient algorithms and solutions for dexterous and robust manipulation, the industrial applications are seldom seen. This workshop aims to address and hopefully bridge this gap by inviting leading researchers from academia to discuss the recent advances in the field and industry-experts to share their experiences and needs from the contact-rich robotic manipulation in industry. We hope this workshop can encourage discussions about possible transfers between the academic results and industrial applications.

## Topics of interest
- Non-prehensile Manipulation
- Manipulation through External Contacts
- In-hand Manipulation
- Multi-modal Manipulation Planning
- Grasp planning, Motion planning, and Task Planning for Manipulators
- Model/Policy Learning for Manipulation through Contacts
- Whole-body Manipulation
- Locomotion/Self-manipulation considering Contacts and Gravitational Constraints

## Call for Open Talks
In this workshop, we have a one-hour open talk session. Application is open to both academia and industry. Selected presenters will talk about their work during the open talk session.

### Format
Each talk will last ten minutes, including both the talk and Q&A.

### How to apply
Please send an email to ____ with title "Application for open talk".
Please include the following information in your email:
- Title and abstract of your talk;
- Brief self-introduction. (< 100 words)

Please apply early, as the positions are limited.

### List of open talks
A list will be availableon before the workshop.
